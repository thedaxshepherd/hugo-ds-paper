This also means understanding the source systems like Netsuite or a custom payroll application and how the business is using them to store data.\nI use SQL Server Integration Services to pull the data from the source systems (Payroll, Netsuite ERP, JD Edwards), store it in SQL Server 2019, build the data model using Tabular Editor with Model Auto Build (C# scripting) and deploy it to SQL Server Analysis Services 2019. I try and follow best practices and only pull the columns needed and use Views to pull the data from - Model Auto build helps enforce some best practices too. I use DAX Studio for building queries, creating measures in DAX, and performance tuning. Currently, I am using both Tabular Editor 2 (3 does not have command line support yet) and 3.\nFor the main model, I am using Model Auto Build which uses an Excel file with the metadata in it to build the model. Since it is essentially a C# script I can make changes to the code if needed and also raise an issue with the author if any bugs are found. Because there is no GUI is requires me to visualize the model and to draw out how it should look (yes, I use giant sketch pads still. It also emphasizes only pulling in the data that is needed to meet the requirements. Then I use Powershell scripts to deploy and refresh the model. With different branches on Azure DevOps, I can deploy to dev, test, and production.\nWe have Excel and Power BI as the clients connecting to the model.\nSpeaking of Excel, I am a big fan of Power Query and love teaching people how to use it.\nWe currently use TFS but I am transitioning some of my projects to git using GitHub and Azure DevOps.\nOn my list of what I am currently learning or need to get up to speed on is C# (mainly for automating the data model creation in Tabular Editor), Dataflows, and Power BI Premium.\nOn a daily basis, I also am using Windows Terminal and Visual Studio Code (in fact that is what I am writing my markdown with).\nMy first love is SQL which I still interact with daily but I love working with the Tabular data model. I love the satisfaction that comes from building a model from many different data sources and building the DAX measures that extract the information the business needs. Especially knowing that the model replaces processes that manually would have taken hours if not days to reach the same insight.\n","wordCount":"537","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/hugo-ds-paper/mywork/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"The DAX Shepherd","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/hugo-ds-paper/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/placeholder.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=50>Home</a>
