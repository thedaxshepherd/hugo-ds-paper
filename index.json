[{"content":"1211 After a period of not defining measures in DAX Studio, I seem to make the same two mistakes.\nThe first error occurs when I try to run the following code to define a measure in a query:\nDEFINE MEASURE [UnitPrice] = SUM(\u0026#39;Sales\u0026#39;[Unit Price]) EVALUATE CALCULATE([UnitPrice]) This generates the following error: The syntax for \u0026lsquo;=\u0026rsquo; is incorrect. .\nThe issue lies in not including the table name before the measure name. This esentially indicates where the measure \u0026ldquo;lives\u0026rdquo; in the model and is needed for the full definition of the measure.\nSo I am going to use the Sales table for the home of the measure. This does not impact how the measure works. I could have just as well chosen the Product table and the result would be the same. But if this were Power BI or Analysis Services where you place the measures is more about organization and making the user experience more intuitive.\nHere I have added the Sales table to the name of the measure.\nMore info on defining a measure can be found here: https://dax.guide/st/measure/\nBut running the full version of the code still generates an error: Query (1, 1) The expression specified in the query is not a valid table expression.Especially when you are learning to use DAX Studio you may run into this error a lot. What it is telling us is that the code we are running is not returning a table expression. We know that when we query using DAX we usually either return a scalar or a table value. If you are not sure what functions return which you can use a site like https://dax.guide/ and it will show the input as well as the return type. Calculate returns a scalar whereas CalculateTable returns a Table.\nOne trick to turn this Scalar into a table is to use the ROW function. It takes the name of the new column and the expression for the column and returns a table with one or more columns:\nThis runs successfully With the ROW function we can give the column a name. We can also repeat this for as many columns as we need.\nAnother option is we can use the table constructor syntax to create a table.\nBut this does not allow us to name the column. But we can add multiple rows to each column if we want.\nThese two issues are ones that I encountered a lot when starting to use DAX Studio. Mostly due to the time period between when I would be using DAX Studio.\n","permalink":"https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/hugo-ds-paper/post/adding-measures-dax-studio/defining-measures-in-dax-studio/","summary":"1211 After a period of not defining measures in DAX Studio, I seem to make the same two mistakes.\nThe first error occurs when I try to run the following code to define a measure in a query:\nDEFINE MEASURE [UnitPrice] = SUM(\u0026#39;Sales\u0026#39;[Unit Price]) EVALUATE CALCULATE([UnitPrice]) This generates the following error: The syntax for \u0026lsquo;=\u0026rsquo; is incorrect. .\nThe issue lies in not including the table name before the measure name.","title":"Defining Measures in DAX Studio"},{"content":"I would like to say that this blog has been relaunched on GitHub using Hugo. If something never launched in the first place I am not sure it can be relaunched. I initially had a WordPress blog on SiteGround. It never made it out of test. I learned a lot about deploying WordPress and the different plugins. It did come in handy when my work started using WordPress for the company site. One of the things I immediately noticed is our site did not have a Favicon.\nMoving the blog to GitHub pages was motivated by a couple of factors. The first, it is hard to justify paying for hosting when nothing is being posted to the public. When the renewal came due, it was time to try a different option.\nThe second reason is that by hosting it on GitHub it would encourage me to learn git.\nI chose Hugo as the static site generator for a couple reasons. It uses one executable for the program without a bunch of dependencies. It uses Go as the template language and I was hoping for one that used a C like language.\nCurrently I am using the DPSG theme for Hugo. I had minimo while developing the site and then Mainroad. DPSG is a fork of Mainroad. I tend to fixate more on the theme instead of the content. I am trying to stick with a theme until I create enough content. I am using Hugo modules for the theme. This makes it easy to update when a new version of the theme comes out.\nI am using PrismJSfor the syntax highlighting. Chroma which Hugo uses does not support languages such as DAX or M (Power Query). With PrismJS you can select what languages and options you want to support and then add the references to the config file for the JS and CSS files.\nI chose to setup my deployment using 3 repositories. I use one for the source code that has the visibility set to private. I deploy using a Bash script. The repository for the Public folder is using a git submodule and is set to public visibility. Lastly, I have public repository for the comments.\nI am using utterancesfor the blog comments. It uses GitHub issues to store the blog comments. I still have the option to turn off blog comments on a per post basis using the variable in the front matter.\nTo edit the markdown I use Visual Studio Code. It allows me to preview the code as I write. I use Windows Terminalwhich allows me to have multiple tabs open with Git Bash, PowerShell, and Command Prompt. Windows Terminal is amazing and keeps getting better.\nProfile picture and various art on the site is by Martin Bérubé. I have zero artistic ability and really like his animated drawings. When I first setup the blog on WordPress I used the drawing of the sheep as a placeholder for my profile picture - watermark and all. When it came time to pick the actual profile picture I had become attached to the picture. I went ahead and purchased it from Martin.\nThis is a place where I can discuss my journey with learning new topics on things that interest me. The main focus will be around the Microsoft BI Stack. Topics such as the DAX language, DAX Studio, Tabular Editor, Analysis Services and Power BI. I also plan to discuss tools that help facilitate that journey such as Windows Terminal and Visual Studio Code.\n","permalink":"https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/hugo-ds-paper/post/website-hugo-for-blog/website-hugo-blog-git/","summary":"How I setup this blog","title":"Using Hugo and GitHub Pages for my blog"},{"content":"Sample DAX code\nPrism:\nEVALUATE\rCALCULATE ( SUM ( \u0026#39;AcctBal\u0026#39;[Amount] ), \u0026#39;AcctBal\u0026#39;[Type] = \u0026#39;AA\u0026#39; ) let m ","permalink":"https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/hugo-ds-paper/post/my-first-post/my-first-post/","summary":"This article is to test out the syntax highlighting for DAX code using Prism.

I grew up in Southern California in the town of Perris.\nMy first computer was a Commodore 64. Since then I have been hooked on computers. I would go to the computer show at the fairgrounds to buy all the parts to build or upgrade my pc. Building my newest PC was a different experience since all I had to do was click to purchase the parts and wait for them to arrive.\nI did not grow up being into fitness or sports. But once I moved to Nashville I got involved in running with the East Nasty group (a great place to meet people) and strength training with Nashville KettleBell. Both Nashville Kettlebell and the East Nasty running group changed my life for good. Up until that point I really had never done any strength training. Nashville Kettlebell has since closed but I finally found a new home in Mt Juliet CrossFit.\nI like to read books - trying to balance not just reading technical books. I like inspirational stories where people have gone beyond what they thought was possible and the latest fictional series I have been reading is the detective series of Bosch.\nCooking is something we all do out of necessity but I think it is something I enjoy. It can be cathartic taking all of these individual components and creating something that brings enjoyment to people. As of this year, I also have a smoker and have started to use it more frequently.\nI love roller coasters and going to theme parks. We try and visit DollyWood when we can. One of the people I follow on Twitter is Dr SQLwho also runs a picture a day account on Twitter for Disneyand Dollywood. Always a great way to brighten the day.On the weekends you may find me at the lake running SAG for my wife and her paddleboard. Or I may be behind the camera at church filming the service (and you thought Cloverfield had a shaky camera). Volunteering in the production team is definitely outside my normal world. They have a different language and skill set that is impressive.\n","permalink":"https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/hugo-ds-paper/about/","summary":"My name is Jason Romans and I work on the Microsoft business intelligence stack.\nI live in Nashville, Tennessee with my wife.

What this means is that I have to be self motivated to learn new skills and to apply them to projects I am working on. I had to have faith that if I built out data models using Microsoft BI that the business would see the value and benefit. A build and and they will come scenario. Lastly it means that I have to wear many hats from gathering requirements from the business to developing the best data model, to creating measures, and lastly to how the data will be presented on the canvas (whether Excel or Power BI). This also means understanding the source systems like Netsuite or a custom payroll application and how the business is using them to store data.\nI use SQL Server Integration Services to pull the data from the source systems (Payroll, Netsuite ERP, JD Edwards), store it in SQL Server 2019, build the data model using Tabular Editor with Model Auto Build (C# scripting) and deploy it to SQL Server Analysis Services 2019. I try and follow best practices and only pull the columns needed and use Views to pull the data from - Model Auto build helps enforce some best practices too. I use DAX Studio for building queries, creating measures in DAX, and performance tuning. Currently, I am using both Tabular Editor 2 (3 does not have command line support yet) and 3.\nFor the main model, I am using Model Auto Build which uses an Excel file with the metadata in it to build the model. Since it is essentially a C# script I can make changes to the code if needed and also raise an issue with the author if any bugs are found. Because there is no GUI is requires me to visualize the model and to draw out how it should look (yes, I use giant sketch pads still. It also emphasizes only pulling in the data that is needed to meet the requirements. Then I use Powershell scripts to deploy and refresh the model. With different branches on Azure DevOps, I can deploy to dev, test, and production.\nWe have Excel and Power BI as the clients connecting to the model.\nSpeaking of Excel, I am a big fan of Power Query and love teaching people how to use it.\nWe currently use TFS but I am transitioning some of my projects to git using GitHub and Azure DevOps.\nOn my list of what I am currently learning or need to get up to speed on is C# (mainly for automating the data model creation in Tabular Editor), Dataflows, and Power BI Premium.\nOn a daily basis, I also am using Windows Terminal and Visual Studio Code (in fact that is what I am writing my markdown with).\nMy first love is SQL which I still interact with daily but I love working with the Tabular data model. I love the satisfaction that comes from building a model from many different data sources and building the DAX measures that extract the information the business needs. Especially knowing that the model replaces processes that manually would have taken hours if not days to reach the same insight.\n","permalink":"https://thedaxshepherd.github.io/hugo-ds-paper/mywork/","summary":"I work in a small IT shop.
